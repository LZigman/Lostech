States:
idle (if player outside of detection radius)
moveToAttack (if player inside detection radius but outside attack radius)
attack (if player in attack radius)

idle -> moveToAttack
moveToAttack -> attack
attack -> moveToAttack
moveToAttack -> idle

idle	-> Physics2D.OverlapCircle (of size detectionRadius)
	-> if player detected transition to moveToAttack

moveToAttack	-> track playerTransform and move towards him at movementSpeed,
		-> if Physics2D.OverlapCircle (of size attackRadius) detects player -> transition to attack
		-> if player exits detectionRadius transition to idle
attack	-> every attackFreq secs deal damage to player (through OverlapCircle get collider -> playerScript)
	-> if player exits attack radius transition to moveToAttack
